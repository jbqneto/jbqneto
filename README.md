# Jbqneto

This is a project for the future, to create my personal web page.

## Development server

It's in angular because its the UI Framework I'm more used to.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
